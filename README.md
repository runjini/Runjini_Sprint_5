# EDA for Lego

**Author:** Runjini Murthy

__*Project Description:*__
Using a set of CSV files from Kaggle, this project involved performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) using plots and joins.

Included in this folder are the R script and the data files from the Kaggle Lego set.

This project is just the starting point of further analysis.  Given the questions raised, it would be helpful for further study of isolating data, using colors to differentiate subgroups, bar graphs. Additionally, functions/loops would be helpful when it comes to cleaning up column headers for joins.
